## Installation:
1. unpack archive to any directory that you have full access
2. Put rhubarb.exe (and other dependacies for it if available) at the same directory with GenRhubarb.exe
3. put ffmpeg.exe binary and other dependacies in ffmpeg/ folder. genRhubarb looks for "ffmpeg/ffmpeg.exe" relative to itself.
that's it.

## Usage
1. Run the GenRhubarb
2. put 9 mouth shape png images A through X, in a folder, click "pick image folder" and pick the first image, generally "something_A.png". see example LISA image folder. 
3. put your wav file at the same folder as GenRhubarb.exe and click "pick wav" select your audio file.
4. set resolution.
5. click "start encoding",  you will see some text output in the status bar, give some time, those are intensive conversions, after a while conversions will finish and you will see the mp4 file in the same folder.
